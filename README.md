# ItemCloud
## The PocketMine-MP plugin which provides item cloud service to PocketMine and EconomyPShop.

#### Fixed by Haxley for v1.2 "Better Together" update. Also ```/itemcloud list``` now displays item names instead of IDs.

ItemCloud Commands:

```/itemcloud register``` : You MUST use this command before using the service.

```/itemcloud upload <item ID> <amount>``` : You can upload your item(s) into your account.

```/itemcloud download <item ID> <amount>``` : You can download your item(s) from your account.

```/itemcloud list``` : You can see the list of all items in your account.

```/itemcloud count <item id>``` : You can see the amount you have of a specific item.
